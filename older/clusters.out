Cluster 1
Summary: The comments are about a humorous post that has gone viral, with users praising its cleverness and making jokes in response. Some commenters compare the post to other pop culture references.

Cluster 2
Summary: It seems like there's been a mix-up with an article and its availability online.

The conversation started with someone mentioning Dr Curry's predictions being commissioned by TV channel Bravo to celebrate its 21st anniversary on air. They then questioned whether this was the same American TV channel Bravo, known for shows like "Queer Eye," "Top Chef," and "West Wing" re-runs.

The discussion took a turn when someone mentioned not being able to access the article due to it being behind a paywall or only available to subscribers. Another person suggested that articles from Salon.com are often behind a paywall, which could explain why the link wasn't working.

Throughout the conversation, people shared their thoughts and opinions on the article's accuracy, the value of old information, and the importance of citing sources. Some also criticized the article for being sensationalized or lacking in depth.

It seems like the original article was not accessible to everyone, which caused some frustration and confusion. If you're interested in finding out more about Dr Curry's predictions or TV channel Bravo, I'd be happy to help you with a new search!

Summary: It seems like you've written a series of comments addressing various points related to evolution, science, and faith. I'll do my best to summarize and respond to each point.

**1. Evolution and Design**

You mention that evolution is being applied to existing ideas, such as sociology, and that this application is driven by the desire to make evolution explain everything about everything. You also highlight the limitations of evolutionary theory in explaining the origin of life and DNA. You conclude that the intricacy of nature speaks to a careful design that humans may be able to understand with research.

Response: While it's true that evolution has been applied to various fields, this doesn't necessarily mean that these applications are driven by a desire to make evolution explain everything about everything. Many scientists use evolutionary principles as a tool for understanding complex systems and processes. As for the limitations of evolutionary theory, you're correct that there are still many unanswered questions, but this doesn't necessarily lead to a conclusion that design is the primary explanation.

**2. The Creator**

You argue that if nature is amazing, then its creator must be even more amazing. You also mention that many scientists have started investigating because of their creationist worldview.

Response: While it's true that many scientists have been motivated by a desire to understand and appreciate God's creation, this doesn't necessarily mean that their scientific work is driven by a desire to prove the existence of a creator. Many scientists are secular humanists who believe in evolution as an explanation for the natural world.

**3. The Assertion "any arena of free thought will eventually result in atheism"**

You challenge the assertion that any arena of free thought will eventually lead to atheism, citing examples from science and journalism.

Response: While it's true that some scientists and journalists have become atheists, this doesn't necessarily mean that free thought leads directly to atheism. Many people engage in critical thinking and intellectual inquiry without becoming atheists.

**4. The Analogy "Clothes make the man"**

You compare the assertion about free thought leading to atheism with Mark Twain's witty phrase "Clothes make the man." You argue that just because something is clever or witty, it doesn't mean it's true.

Response: I agree with you on this point. While assertions like these may be amusing and insightful, they shouldn't be taken as absolute truths without further consideration.

**5. The Nature of God**

You respond to the challenge of explaining how Jesus' claim to being God relates to the nature of God. You propose that God has multiple personalities (three to be exact) - a view that is distinct from the traditional Christian understanding of the Trinity.

Response: While your proposal is an interesting one, it's not a standard interpretation of the Trinity in Christianity. The Trinity is typically understood as one God with three distinct persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), each of whom shares the same divine essence and attributes. Your proposal raises important questions about the nature of God, but it doesn't necessarily address the original challenge.

Cluster 11
Summary: It seems like you're discussing a few different topics, but I'll try to summarize and respond to each one.

**Damage to property**

You mentioned damaging someone's property and feeling frustrated with the police response. If you've indeed damaged someone's property, it would be best to own up to it and take responsibility for your actions. Depending on the severity of the damage, you may need to make restitution or repair the property.

Regarding the police response, you're right that in many cases, especially when theft occurs after the fact, the police focus on filing reports rather than recovering stolen items. However, this doesn't mean they won't try to recover stolen goods if possible.

**Property rights and ownership**

You're arguing that rights are based on property ownership, which is an interesting perspective. While it's true that owning something grants certain privileges and responsibilities, it's not necessarily the sole basis for human rights. Many people would argue that basic human rights, such as life, liberty, and security of person, exist regardless of one's property ownership status.

You also mentioned that if someone doesn't own themselves, they're essentially a slave. This is an extreme view, but I understand your point about the importance of self-ownership and autonomy.

**SETI and the search for extraterrestrial life**

You expressed skepticism about the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) initiative, suggesting that the focus on finding life elsewhere in the universe might be driven by human emotionalism rather than objective scientific evidence. While it's true that the search for extraterrestrial life is often fueled by optimism and a desire to find answers to fundamental questions, it's also based on a robust scientific framework.

**Libertarian views on taxation and social welfare**

You mentioned being opposed to taxation as a means of redistributing wealth, arguing that if people had more disposable income due to lower taxes, they could better afford healthcare and donate to charities. While this is an understandable perspective, it's essential to acknowledge the complexities of taxation and social welfare systems.

**Pet rats and domestication**

You shared your experience with pet rats, which are indeed intelligent animals capable of being trained and cared for as pets. This highlights the importance of recognizing the differences between wild and domesticated animals, even within the same species.

**Changes in US manufacturing employment**

Finally, you noted the decline in manufacturing employment in the United States over the past few decades, from 30% of employees in the 1950s to around 1 in 12 jobs today. This trend is a result of various factors, including automation, globalization, and changes in economic policies.

Please let me know if I've missed any points or if you'd like me to elaborate on these topics!

However, comment #3 mentions "Styles" and says they are "shockingly easy to use" in Word 2007, which suggests that the person is happy with the program's functionality.
